TASK DESCRIPTION : This task involved creating a weather application using React that fetches and displays weather data from an API based on user input. I used the OpenWeather API to get real-time weather information and displayed it in a user-friendly format on the frontend. To handle the API requests, I utilized React's `useEffect` and `useState` hooks, ensuring that the app responds to user input and updates the UI accordingly.

The app is designed to be responsive, adapting its layout to work smoothly across different screen sizes. When the user enters the name of a city, the app fetches weather data from the OpenWeather API and displays key information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description. I used Axios to handle the API calls and ensured that error handling is in place in case of an invalid city name or API issues.

The user interface was designed with simplicity in mind, focusing on providing clear and easily accessible weather information. I made sure to style the app with CSS and used Bootstrap for some responsive design elements to make it look good on mobile devices as well as desktops.

One of the challenges I faced was managing the state of the API data and dealing with asynchronous requests. I used `async/await` syntax in combination with Reactâ€™s state management to ensure smooth data fetching and updates. I also ensured that the user is notified if there are any issues fetching data (e.g., if the city name is incorrect or there are network issues).

The app provides a great user experience by displaying weather data quickly and updating the UI whenever the user searches for a new city. It also handles loading states and error messages to keep the user informed. I used resources like the React documentation and tutorials on sites like W3Schools and MDN to better understand API integration and React hooks.

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in building a functional React app, integrating it with external APIs, and managing asynchronous operations in React. It was a valuable exercise that helped me solidify my understanding of React and how to fetch and display data dynamically.
